Description
This is my first project on Apache Airflow. It creates an automated workflow to extract daily historical stock data from publicly traded companies. Data is collected for Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) and saved in CSV format. This project shows the practical application of Airflow in managing and automating data extraction processes.
